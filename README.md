--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Initialization:
   - The necessary libraries, including "mbed.h", are included at the beginning of the code.
   - Pin assignments and configurations are set using the defined variables and objects.
   - The PWM_M and PWM_L objects are created to control the two PWM outputs for motor speed control.
   - The Ma and Mb objects are defined as DigitalOut for controlling the motor's direction.
   - The flash object is defined as DigitalOut for toggling the onboard flash LED.
   - The B_Dir and B_Speed objects are defined as InterruptIn for detecting button presses.

2. Interrupt Handlers:
   - The Mot_Dir_Flip function is triggered when a falling edge is detected on the B_Dir pin. It toggles the direction control pins (Ma and Mb) to change the motor's direction.
   - The Mot_Speed function is triggered when a falling edge is detected on the B_Speed pin. It increments the speed value (i) and sets the PWM duty cycle for both PWM outputs (PWM_M and PWM_L) based on the updated speed value. If the speed reaches the maximum value, it resets back to zero.

3. Main Function:
   - Inside the main function, the period of the PWM signals is set to 1ms for both PWM_M and PWM_L.
   - The Mot_Dir_Flip function is attached to the falling edge interrupt of the B_Dir pin using the fall() function.
   - The Mot_Speed function is attached to the falling edge interrupt of the B_Speed pin using the fall() function.
   - The initial direction of the motor is set to forward by setting Ma = 0 and Mb = 1.

4. Control Loop:
   - The main loop of the program toggles the flash LED by toggling the flash pin using the ! (logical NOT) operator.
   - A delay of 25ms (HAL_Delay) is introduced to control the LED blinking speed.

5. Operation:
   - When the program is executed, the motor starts with the initial direction set to forward.
   - Pressing the user button (B_Dir) triggers the Mot_Dir_Flip function, which toggles the direction control pins, changing the motor's direction.
   - Pressing the external button (B_Speed) triggers the Mot_Speed function, which increments the speed value (i) and sets the PWM duty cycle accordingly. The speed gradually increases until it reaches the maximum value (1), and then resets back to zero.
   - The onboard flash LED and external LED provide visual feedback, indicating the motor's operation and direction.

By utilizing the interrupt-driven approach and PWM signals, the code allows for the dynamic control of the DC motor's speed and direction. The user can change the motor's direction using the user button and adjust the speed using the external button. The PWM signals generated by the Nucleo F401RE microcontroller control the motor driver, resulting in precise speed control. The flashing LED provides a visual indication of the program's execution.

Through experimentation, it was observed that the PWM signals effectively controlled the speed of the DC motor. By varying the duty cycle of the PWM signals, the motor speed could be adjusted. The user button allowed for easy direction changes, and the external button provided convenient speed control. The onboard flash LED and external LED provided visual feedback, indicating the motor's operation and direction.

4. Conclusion:
